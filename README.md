# Next.js 15: Silent 500 Errors from Unhandled `getServerSideProps` Promises

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur in Next.js 15 applications when using `async/await` within the `getServerSideProps` function.  Unhandled exceptions within the asynchronous operation lead to generic 500 errors on the production server, making debugging difficult.

## Problem

The issue stems from the lack of comprehensive error handling within `getServerSideProps` when using promises. If a promise rejection isn't explicitly handled using a `try...catch` block, the error isn't gracefully propagated to the client, resulting in an unhelpful 500 server error.

## Solution

Implementing robust `try...catch` blocks around asynchronous operations is crucial for handling potential errors and providing more informative error messages to users or logs for easier debugging.
