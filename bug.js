In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using the `async/await` pattern within a `getServerSideProps` function, specifically if the asynchronous operation throws an error and isn't properly handled.  The error might not be caught, resulting in a 500 server error without informative messaging in the production environment, making debugging challenging.  The error details might be logged on the server-side but aren't visibly communicated to the client.
